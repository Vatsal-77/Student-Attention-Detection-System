# Student-Attention-Detection-System

Implemented, HOG algorithms, OpenCV, Python, and dlib libraries detect drowsiness of students during online classes and track
their facial and eye movements during online exams.
Utilized these algorithms and tools, the system sends warning messages to students and alerts the professor if any suspicious
activity is detected.
Achieving an accuracy of 77.95% for drowsiness detection and 81.45% for examination proctoring, the system demonstrates its effectiveness in promoting student engagement and accountability
